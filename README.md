## ðŸ“œ Available Userscripts

Here are some of the awesome userscripts you'll find in this repository:
- *WGB means "won't get you banned"*

- **Tracers**: Traces flowers, mobs, and summoned pets.
- **Auto Grind**: Grinds with mouse movement.
- **Craft Progress**: Allows you to input a petal goal and tracks it for you. (Made by Furaken) *WGB*
- **Guild Script**: Creates a simple script to show guild updates. *WGB*
- **Shaders**: Add realistic shadows to the game! (Fixed by me, originial by Jekyll) *WGB*
- **Anti-AFK**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal, then run the python script `anti-afk.py`. (Bingo)
- **Free Sandbox**: Script by k2r_n2iq, uses memory editing to simulate every petal in your inventory. For this script, you paste it in the console, not with tampermonkey.
- **Account Creator**: Script by Bloss, generates a new guest UUID and edits your localstorage to that ID, giving you a new account. *WGB If used correctly**
- **Version Hash Finder**: Finds your version hash to replace with the old one if super-petals.js doesn't work. If you don't know how to do this, ping me on Discord and I'll update the script so you just have to paste it.
**NONE OF THESE SCRIPTS HAVE GOTTEN ME BANNED YET**
### Tutorials how to operate:
- Tracers, autogrind, autorespawn, all things in hacks.js can be changed to true or false. (1 or 0)
- To operate shaders, press `+`. (Make sure to hold down shift)
- For the sandbox script, you open dev tools, navigate to console, and paste the script. If a warning appears, type `allow pasting` before hitting enter.
Each script besides these should automatically work, if not contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MqvmBu5tWa)
