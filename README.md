## ðŸ“œ Available Userscripts

Here are some of the awesome userscripts you'll find in this repository:
- *WGB means "won't get you banned"*

- **Tracers**: Traces flowers, mobs, and summoned pets.
- **Auto Grind**: Grinds with mouse movement.
- **Craft Progress**: Allows you to input a petal goal and tracks it for you. (Made by Furaken) *WGB*
- **Guild Script**: Creates a simple script to show guild updates. *WGB*
- **Shaders**: Add realistic shadows to the game! (Fixed by me, originial by Jekyll) *WGB*
- **Anti-AFK**: Make issue, look at hacks.js and make it. It's rather easy, I'm just too lazy.
- **Free Sandbox**: Script by k2r_n2iq, uses memory editing to simulate every petal in your inventory. For this script, you paste it in the console, not with tampermonkey.
### Tutorials how to operate:
- Tracers, autogrind, autorespawn, all things in hacks.js can be changed to true or false. (1 or 0)
- To operate shaders, press `+`. (Make sure to hold down shift)
- For the sandbox script, you open dev tools, navigate to console, and paste the script. If a warning appears, type `allow pasting` before hitting enter.
Each script besides these should automatically work, if not contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MqvmBu5tWa)
